# Internships-Trifacta-Workflow
Using Trifacta for the first time, I created a workflow that imports an Excel sheet produced by Python, sorts the data to be more readable, and creates a new Excel file with the sorted data.

`data.txt` contains the text that I continually update in my Notes app on my MacBook. The text is a running list of internships I have applied to in 2024.

`createsheet.py` is a file that leverages two Python libraries, `pandas` and `openpyxl` to create an Excel file from the `.txt` file.

`internships.xlsx` is the produced Excel file.

`Internships Workflow.json` is the raw code for the Trifacta workflow I created.

`Updated Internships Sheet.xlsx` is the newly-sorted internship data as an Excel file.
